# Hi! I'm Nico üëã

## About Me üå±
I'm a recent graduate from Case Western Reserve University where I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Bachelors in Neuroscience. I'm interested in artificial intelligence, web/mobile development, game development, and information security. I‚Äôm currently the lead software engineer at HyperCase CWRU where I work with an interdisciplinary team of medical and graduate students to develop a tool to alleviate provider strain and increase Colorectal Cancer Screening. I am also an intern at MSKai where I'm currently working on features for enhancing mobile and cross-platform usability and developing critical dashboards, alarms, and detail-graphs in AWS. Previously, I have also worked as a machine learning undergraduate researcher where I focused on optimizing grouped kernel pruning techniques to improve the efficiency of convolutional neural networks. Please feel free to reach out! I always welcome new opportunities and eager to exchange ideas and explore collaborations!
