### About Me ðŸŒ±
Hi I'm Nico and I'm currently a senior (class of 2024) at Case Western Reserve University studying Computer Science (B.A) and Neuroscience (B.S) with a minor in Chemistry. I'm interested in artificial intelligence, web/mobile development, game development, and information security. I've had the opportunity to work with a wide array of programming languages and frameworks and have worked extensively in Java and JavaScript (React/Next.js), and I'm also very comfortable with TypeScript, Python, HTML/CSS and C. 

### Experience âœ¨
I'm currently a software engineer intern at MSKai where I'm currently working on enhancing mobile and cross-platform usability (Typscript/Next.js) and previously worked on modularizing API response handling, implemented status code checks across multiple API endpoints, integrated OpenTelemetry for efficient metric capture and export to AWS, and built dashboards in AWS. In the fall of 2023 I worked as a ML/AI Undergraduate Researcher where I delved into the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence research. Working alongside peers and faculty, I focused on optimizing grouped kernel pruning techniques (working in Python and PyTorch) to improve the efficiency of convolutional neural networks. This involved experimentation and collaboration to achieve significant enhancements in inference speed without the need for index remapping. In the summer of 2023 I worked as a software enginer intern at Evercompunds where I worked as a full-time full-stack software engineer intern working on creating software for implementing JIT management practices.
